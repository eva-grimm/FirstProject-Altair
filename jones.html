                        <i>You shoot that gun at me--I will pull that bullet out of my ruined four hundred dollar
                            leather
                            jacket... and I will shove it up your ass with my pinky finger. And which one of us do you
                            think
                            that will hurt more?</i>

                    <!-- basic overview of Jessica Jones -->
                    <h4 class="center-text">Who is Jessica Jones?</h4>
                    <p class="justify-text">Jessica Jones was in a car wreck as a child, and though the rest of her family
                        was killed by it, she
                        survived and was struck with chemicals that gave her superpowers. She was adopted by a family
                        with a
                        child celebrity, who would later go on to become Jessica's best friend, and she kept knowledge
                        of her
                        powers a secret outside of her adoptive family until she grew up and moved out of the house.</p>
                    <p class="justify-text">Though she began her career as the hero Jewel, a run in with the mind controller
                        known as the Purple Man
                        (aka, Zebediah Killgrave) derailed her hero career. She eventually developed immunity to mind
                        control
                        and escaped, but the trauma of the experience left her disillusioned with heroics. She instead
                        became a
                        private investigator and opened her own agency, Alias Investigations, but through her work, she
                        still
                        encountered other metahumans, including Luke Cage, who she would later go on to marry.</p>
                    <p class="justify-text">Jessica Jones is one of the most well-rounded, grounded female characters in the
                        industry. Her escape
                        from her abuser, her struggles with trauma and coping through alcohol, and her efforts to
                        balance her work and personal
                        lifes make her exceedingly relatable.</p>
