            <img src="/img/JessicaJones.jpg" alt="Jessica Jones" class="detailsImage col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3"/>
            <p align="justify">Jessica Jones was in a car wreck as a child, and though the rest of her family was killed by it, she
                survived and was struck with chemicals that gave her superpowers. She was adopted by a family with a
                child celebrity, who would later go on to become Jessica's best friend, and she kept knowledge of her
                powers a secret outside of her adoptive family until she grew up and moved out of the house.</p>
            <p align="justify">Though she began her career as the hero Jewel, a run in with the mind controller known as the Purple Man
                (aka, Zebediah Killgrave) derailed her hero career. She eventually developed immunity to mind control
                and escaped, but the trauma of the experience left her disillusioned with heroics. She instead became a
                private investigator and opened her own agency, Alias Investigations, but through her work, she still
                encountered other metahumans, including Luke Cage, who she would later go on to marry.</p>
            <p align="justify">Jessica Jones is one of the most well-rounded, grounded female characters in the industry. Her escape
                from her abuser, her struggles with trauma and coping through alcohol, and her efforts to balance her work and personal
                lifes make her exceedingly relatable.</p>
